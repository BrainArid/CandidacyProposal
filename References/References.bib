  Abstract                 = {The mammalian cerebral cortex supports cognitive functions such as sensorimotor      integration, memory, and social behaviors. Normal brain function relies on a      diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and      vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)       to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal CA1 region.      We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell      types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment      with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron      expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by      Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed       a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of      adult cell type identity.},

  Title                    = {ARACNE: an algorithm for the reconstruction of gene regulatory networks in a      mammalian cellular context.},
  __markedentry            = {[Brian:6]},
  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding      normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational       methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been      successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE,      a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to      scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general      enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method      uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect      interactions inferred by co-expression methods. RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE      reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the      network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in      practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We      assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using       both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells.      On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms      established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks.      Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells      demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the      cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual      information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual      information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE      shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian      cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering      algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to      elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify       molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.

  Abstract                 = {New high-dimensional, single-cell technologies offer unprecedented resolution in       the analysis of heterogeneous tissues. However, because these technologies can      measure dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data      interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one       to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the      high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual       similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension      to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with       viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow      automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into      malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other.       We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse      samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal      residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell      technology.

  Abstract                 = {It has long been the dream of biologists to map gene expression at the      single-cell level. With such data one might track heterogeneous cell      sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways.      Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is      an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual      cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput      droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual       cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a      surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based      assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the      population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after      leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these      high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and      infer gene expression relationships. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a new method for analyzing microarray time courses by      identifying genes that undergo abrupt transitions in expression level, and the      time at which the transitions occur. The algorithm matches the sequence of      expression levels for each gene against temporal patterns having one or two      transitions between two expression levels. The algorithm reports a P-value for      the matching pattern of each gene, and a global false discovery rate can also be       computed. After matching, genes can be sorted by the direction and time of      transitions. Genes can be partitioned into sets based on the direction and time      of change for further analysis, such as comparison with Gene Ontology annotations      or binding site motifs. The method is evaluated on simulated and actual      time-course data. On microarray data for budding yeast, it is shown that the      groups of genes that change in similar ways and at similar times have significant      and relevant Gene Ontology annotations.

  Abstract                 = {Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in      uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and      editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently,      substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from      technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to      study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in      quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per      cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between       50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical      stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant      differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical      variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in      subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and      splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and      allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage       that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that       transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content       and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material.      Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for      analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states. FAU - Marinov, Georgi K},

  Abstract                 = {DNA microarray technology can accommodate a multifaceted analysis of the      expression of genes in an organism. The wealth of spatiotemporal data generated      by this technology allows researchers to potentially reverse engineer a      particular genetic network. "Fuzzy logic" has been proposed as a method to      analyze the relationships between genes and help decipher a genetic network. This      method can identify interacting genes that fit a known "fuzzy" model of gene      interaction by testing all combinations of gene expression profiles. This paper      introduces improvements made over previous fuzzy gene regulatory models in terms       of computation time and robustness to noise. Improvement in computation time is      achieved by using a cluster analysis as a preprocessing method to reduce the      total number of gene combinations analyzed. This approach speeds up the algorithm      by a factor of 50% with minimal effect on the results. The model's sensitivity to      noise is reduced by implementing appropriate methods of "fuzzy rule aggregation"       and "conjunction" that produce reliable results in the face of minor changes in      model input.

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular       differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential      heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell       data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate      approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and      clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular      differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead      expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages. RESULTS: Here, we      propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining      differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by      adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing      measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering       of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this      output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates      from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells       move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated      states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of      our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling       density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell      quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem      cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of human      pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better      than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for       non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour      Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of      cells.

  Abstract                 = {Gene regulatory networks model regulation in living organisms. Fuzzy logic can      effectively model gene regulation and interaction to accurately reflect the      underlying biology. A new multiscale fuzzy clustering method allows genes to      interact between regulatory pathways and across different conditions at different      levels of detail. Fuzzy cluster centers can be used to quickly discover causal      relationships between groups of coregulated genes. Fuzzy measures weight expert      knowledge and help quantify uncertainty about the functions of genes using      annotations and the gene ontology database to confirm some of the interactions.      The method is illustrated using gene expression data from an experiment on      carbohydrate metabolism in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Key gene      regulatory relationships were evaluated using information from the gene ontology       database. A new regulatory relationship concerning trehalose regulation of      carbohydrate metabolism was also discovered in the extracted network. FAU - Du, Pan},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to analyze multiple single-cell parameters is critical for      understanding cellular heterogeneity. Despite recent advances in measurement      technology, methods for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data are often      subjective, labor intensive and require prior knowledge of the biological system.      To objectively uncover cellular heterogeneity from single-cell measurements, we      present a versatile computational approach, spanning-tree progression analysis of      density-normalized events (SPADE). We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of      mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases,      SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially      recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE      is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers. SPADE      facilitates the analysis of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of cell      types and comparison of functional markers in response to perturbations. FAU - Qiu, Peng},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a novel algorithm for analyzing gene expression data. This      algorithm uses fuzzy logic to transform expression values into qualitative      descriptors that can be evaluated by using a set of heuristic rules. In our tests      we designed a model to find triplets of activators, repressors, and targets in a       yeast gene expression data set. For the conditions tested, the predictions made      by the algorithm agree well with experimental data in the literature. The      algorithm can also assist in determining the function of uncharacterized proteins      and is able to detect a substantially larger number of transcription factors than      could be found at random. This technology extends current techniques such as      clustering in that it allows the user to generate a connected network of genes      using only expression data. FAU - Woolf, P J},

  Abstract                 = {Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of variables in large data sets is increasingly important. Here, we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function. MIC belongs to a larger class of maximal information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics for identifying and classifying relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in global health, gene expression, major-league baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify known and novel relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between      distinct substates; however, the regulatory circuits specifying these states and       enabling transitions between them are not well understood. Here we set out to      characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in mouse PSCs by single-cell      expression profiling under different chemical and genetic perturbations.      Signalling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression,       with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell      divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced       by perturbation of signalling pathways and chromatin regulators. Notably, either       removal of mature microRNAs or pharmacological blockage of signalling pathways      drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured      pluripotency network, enhanced self-renewal and a distinct chromatin state, an      effect mediated by opposing microRNA families acting on the Myc/Lin28/let-7 axis.      These data provide insight into the nature of transcriptional heterogeneity in      PSCs. FAU - Kumar, Roshan M},

  Abstract                 = {Cellular circuits sense the environment, process signals, and compute decisions      using networks of interacting proteins. To model such a system, the abundance of       each activated protein species can be described as a stochastic function of the      abundance of other proteins. High-dimensional single-cell technologies, such as      mass cytometry, offer an opportunity to characterize signaling circuit-wide.      However, the challenge of developing and applying computational approaches to      interpret such complex data remains. Here, we developed computational methods,      based on established statistical concepts, to characterize signaling network      relationships by quantifying the strengths of network edges and deriving      signaling response functions. In comparing signaling between naive and      antigen-exposed CD4(+) T lymphocytes, we find that although these two cell      subtypes had similarly wired networks, naive cells transmitted more information      along a key signaling cascade than did antigen-exposed cells. We validated our      characterization on mice lacking the extracellular-regulated mitogen-activated      protein kinase (MAPK) ERK2, which showed stronger influence of pERK on pS6      (phosphorylated-ribosomal protein S6), in naive cells as compared with      antigen-exposed cells, as predicted. We demonstrate that by using cell-to-cell      variation inherent in single-cell data, we can derive response functions      underlying molecular circuits and drive the understanding of how cells process      signals.},
