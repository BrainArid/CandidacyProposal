  Abstract                 = {New high-dimensional, single-cell technologies offer unprecedented resolution in       the analysis of heterogeneous tissues. However, because these technologies can      measure dozens of parameters simultaneously in individual cells, data      interpretation can be challenging. Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one       to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the      high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual       similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension      to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with       viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow      automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into      malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other.       We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse      samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal      residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell      technology.
